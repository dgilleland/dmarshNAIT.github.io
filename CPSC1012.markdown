**To compile & run a C# Program**
Run *Developer Command Prompt* and navigate to the location of the .cs file using `cd`.
Compile by running:
```csc Payroll.cs``` where Payroll.cs is the name of your .cs file.
This will create an executable file called Payroll.exe, which we can run by typing:
```Payroll.exe```
