## Miscellanea

- ### To compile & run a C# Program

   Run **Developer Command Prompt** and navigate to the location of the .cs file using `cd`.
   Compile by running ```csc Payroll.cs``` (where _Payroll.cs_ is the name of your .cs file).
   This will create an executable file called _Payroll.exe_, which we can run by typing ```Payroll.exe```.

- ### Conditional operator

   Here is an example of how we can use the conditional operator in place of an `if` statement.
